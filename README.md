# Building a Recommender Systems using the Steam Dataset

### The implementation of the recommender system will cover three use cases. These use cases can be seen as how the user interacts on the Steam platform and receives recommendations based on his/her preferences on games.

### Use Case #1: Recommending Bundles to a User Based on Most Played Genres
### Use Case #2: Bundle Generation and Recommendation for a Group of Users
### Use Case #3: Recommending Specific Games to a User Based on User Selected Game
